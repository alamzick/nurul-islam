    I attend nurul-islam private school,It is located in agbeye eyita .
        I want to become a programmer in the future some of my role models are
         programmers like Mosh Hamedani,Tim-Berners-lee and so on . The dream started when I was
            in jss1 when the school management included coding in our curriculum.Then it struck me that
        this was what I was meant to do in my life.</p>
